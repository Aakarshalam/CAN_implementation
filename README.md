# ðŸš— CAN Implementation on STM32

# ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains a basic **Controller Area Network (CAN)** implementation for **STM32 microcontrollers**.  
It provides a minimal and clean starting point focused on **CAN peripheral initialization** and **basic configuration**, making it easier to build custom tasks and higher-level logic on top.

# ðŸ”§ Requirements

- STM32CubeIDE or STM32CubeMX
- STM32 microcontroller (e.g., STM32F103, STM32F4 series)
- USB-to-CAN adapter or transceiver (e.g., MCP2551)
- Standard development tools (compiler, debugger)

# ðŸ“¦ Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/can-implementation.git
