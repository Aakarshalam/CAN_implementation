# CAN Implementation on STM32

# Overview

This repository contains a basic **Controller Area Network (CAN)** implementation for **STM32 microcontrollers**.  
It provides a minimal and clean starting point focused on **CAN peripheral initialization** and **basic configuration**, making it easier to build custom tasks and higher-level logic on top.
